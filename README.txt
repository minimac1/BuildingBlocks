# Building Blocks

## Lets see how far we can take this project :)

As of the first creation of this repositiory, the aim of this project is a personal ambition that will help develop my artistic skills as well as have fun being creative.

## Sub-Projects featured in this personal project will be:

1. Create a website that should contain information about this project and anything else interesting/related

2. Create a drawing that will start simple and help me understand my tools well

3. Eventually get to a stage where I can produce youtube videos that will likely feature simple looped animation + music, and sketch cute anime girls in under 10 mins :)
